DeepMind Technologies is a British artificial intelligence subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. and research laboratory founded in September 2010.
DeepMind was acquired by Google[4] in 2014. The company is based in London, with research centres in Canada, France,[6] and the United States. 
In 2015, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, Google's parent company.
DeepMind has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans, as well as a Neural Turing machine,
or a neural network that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional Turing machine,
resulting in a computer that mimics the short-term memory of the human brain.
DeepMind made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol, the world champion, in a five-game match, which was the subject of a documentary film.
A more general program, AlphaZero, beat the most powerful programs playing go, chess and shogi (Japanese chess) after a few days of play against itself using reinforcement learning. 
In 2020, DeepMind made significant advances in the problem of protein folding.

DeepMind was acquired by Google[4] in 2014. The company is based in London, with research centres in Canada, France,[6] and the United States. 
In 2015, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, Google's parent company.
DeepMind has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans, as well as a Neural Turing machine,
or a neural network that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional Turing machine,
resulting in a computer that mimics the short-term memory of the human brain.
DeepMind made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol, the world champion, in a five-game match, which was the subject of a documentary film.
A more general program, AlphaZero, beat the most powerful programs playing go, chess and shogi (Japanese chess) after a few days of play against itself using reinforcement learning.

DeepMind Technologies is a British artificial intelligence subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. and research laboratory founded in September 2010.
DeepMind was acquired by Google[4] in 2014. The company is based in London, with research centres in Canada, France,[6] and the United States. 
In 2015, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, Google's parent company.
DeepMind has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans, as well as a Neural Turing machine,
or a neural network that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional Turing machine,
resulting in a computer that mimics the short-term memory of the human brain.
DeepMind made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol, the world champion, in a five-game match, which was the subject of a documentary film.
